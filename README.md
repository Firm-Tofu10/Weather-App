This prhoject was created by using no starter code however we were provided with a link: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api to a weather api to fetch the weather data. I disided to not use bootstrap for this assignment in order to get some more practice with CSS.

I found this assignment super enjoyable to see the feedback and I also found that the structer of the javascript code in this assignment, my tutor helped me on help me understand what was going on which may be a first with javascript honestly.

This Application lets you see the weather data of any loaction put into the seach bar. Along with this it also will save your seach if found by the API to loacal storage also added some extra code to make sure the saved data dose not duplicate. All in all what this app dose it pretty simple and im very happy with the final result.(I also may return to this assignment after it is graded to add some more specific functionality)
